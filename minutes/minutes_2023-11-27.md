## Topics of Discussion

- Note that UML diagrams are heavily based on class-based design.
- Consider how granular we want to get with our sequence diagrams.
  - Diagram things at the page level for now.
  - We can break things down to the object level later if necessary.
- When working on an Electron app, non-static fonts/images can have difficulties loading.
- Best practices
  - Keep in mind coding styles and uppercasing/lowercasing guidelines.
  - Keep code clean and readable by organizing folder structures appropriately.
  - Consider a file-formatter/linter for spring semester.
  - More discussion to follow in spring semester.

## Summary
